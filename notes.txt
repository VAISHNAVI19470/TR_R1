single page application there is no page reload 
it is modern page

-React is mainly used to create single page application
checking one to one mapping: diffing algorithm

What is virtual DOM
  -it is a vitual representation of UI which is kept in memory later
   synced with real DOM with the help of library called "ReactDOM"

 - updation of real dom with virtual dom

 -the entire process of updating the real dom with the help of VDOM 
  called "Reconsiliation"


JSX:
  -stands for javascipt and XML.
  -it is a javascipt syntax extension used to create HTML-like markup in
  the react.
  -Actual way to create a element in react by using a method called as
       -React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null,content/childeren)
    React.createElement("h1",null,"header")

  -JSX is not a part of react but it is recommended to use in react.

Rules of JSX:
  -1) every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed
  2)more than one JSX is used then they must wrapped with one parent element
  eg:  <div>
            <h1></h1>
            <p></p>
            </div>

JSX expression:
  -it is used to call the variables,mathematical expression inside the element.
  syntax: <h1>{variable/expression}</h1>

Components:
  - Components are the files/modules which consist of js related logics 
  which can be reuse.

  Components can be divided into 2 types;

  1)class based Components(CBC)
  2)functional based Components(FBC)

1)class based Components(BC):
   -CBC is similar to js es6 class.
   -CBS are "statefull" Component because of default state objects parent 
   inside the class
   syntax:
     class Person{
       constructor(name,age){
         this.name=name;
         this.age=age;
         }
   }

   class Child extends Person{
     constructor(name,age,city){
       super(name,age);
       this.city=city;
       }
    }


    syntax:
     class App extends React.Component{
       render(){
         return(
          //JSX
         )
       }
    }
    export default App;

2.functional based Components:
  -FBC are similar to Js functions.
  -FBC are "stateless" because there is no state object untill react v16.8.

  syntax: function App(){
          return(

          )
  }
  export default App;

  OR

  const App=()=>{
  return(
  //JSX
  )
  }
  export default App;

Note:  while creating a react Component the names must be started 



Component composition:
 - Component composition is used to combine multiple Components into single application

rafce: to create functional Component 
rcc: to create class Component

Props:
 -Props is nothing but a properties similar to html attributes.
 -props is an object.
 -prop is an object used to exchange inforomation from parent Component to Child Component
